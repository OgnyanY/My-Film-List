# My-Movie-List

[Description]
A site where a user can add movies and series to personal lists, depending on whether he has watched them or wants to watch them.

[Functionalities]
For each movie and series there is a separate page with their name, year of release, description and rating.
From this page, a user will be able to add the movie or series to their list, depending on whether they have watched it or will watch it.
Each user has lists for movies and series (4 in total). For future ones he will watch and for those he has already watched.
